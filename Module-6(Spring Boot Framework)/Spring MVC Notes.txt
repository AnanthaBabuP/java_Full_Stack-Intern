Notes:
    REST - Representational State Transfer
    STS - Spring Tools Suite
    API - Application Programming Interface:
    --------
         Collection of predefimed Classes and interfaces.
         Example:
            JDBC
            Servlet
    Rest mainly used for developing micro services.

    MVC Application:

        web.xml - deployment descriptor
Spring Boot Introduction:
    1. What is SpringBoot?     
        Spring boot is a adverce version of spring Framework.
        It provide an easier and faster way to set up, configuartion, and run both simple and web-based application.
        It is a Spring Module provide the RAD(Rapid Application Development) feauture ti the spring framework.
        It is used to create stand-alone spring-based application that you can just run because it's need minimul configuration.
        You Can start with several configuration instand of a complite spring configuration.
        SpringBoot is a great platform for java developers to create ready-to run ,self-contains, production-ready spring application.
        
        Spring Boot is a java-based framework that is used for developing Micro services.
        Pivotal is the company that is behind it.
        Spring Boot is some taht maked it siple to condtruct standalone, production-ready spring apps.
        Spring boot include extensive infrastructure support for constructing micro-services, allowing you can construct enterprice-ready application that can also be "simple run".

        Our SpringBoot Tutorial incluse all topices of Spring Boot such as 
            feauture
            project, 
                mavan project
            Wixzard
                Spring initializr,
                CLI,
                applications,
                annotations,
                dependancy Management,
                propertys,
                starters,
                Actuator,
                JPA,
                JDBC,
                etc...

        
        Spring Framework (+) Empaded Http Servers(Tomcat, jetty) (-) XML<bean> Configuration or @Configuratin (=) Spring Boot

    2. Differance Between Spring framework(1) VS Spring Boot(2)?
        Refer To Image
        1. Application  
            1. It is used to developing enterprice application
            2. It is used to devlop REST API Application
        2. Based On
            1. Dependancy Injection
            2. AutoConfiguration
        3. in-memmory database:
            1. No in-memmory database
            2. inbuild in-memory database such as H2
        4. program:
            1. It is loosly compled 
            2. It ir stand alone
        5. dependancy descriptor:
            1. It is require dependancy descriptor
            2. No required in dependency descriptor
        6. Server:
            1. we need to set server explicity
            2. Inbuild server such as tomcate and jetty

    3. How to download Spring Boot:
        spring boot download -> Spring | Tools -> Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse 
        -> <Downlaos your system required Application> -> create new folder in driver c or d any drive 
        -> Paste the zip file and extract -> Open extracted folder -> Open folder on click SpringToolSuite Applicatio  And run it.

    4. Create and Run Project:
        file -> new -> Spring  startedproject -> set file name -> set maven project -> next -> (Add needed dependencys) After Click next -> Finish

        OPen file com.example.demo -> @SpringBootApplication Annotaion class -> right click -> Run as -> Spring Boot App -> Shoe the terminal to runing Project.


Spring Boot Dependency Injection:
    Bean Scope: 
        @Component
        @Scope(value = "Bean Scope Name")
    -----------

        1. singleton(default Scope) - only one referance
        2. prototype - 
        3. request
        4. session
        5. global session

Spring Boot Web Application:
    1. Differnace Between spring boot VS Spring MVC:
        Refer to image : Screenshot 2024-11-02 193400

    2. How to create Spring boot web application:
        1. File -> New -> Project -> Spring Started Project -> 
            Name(SB Web Application) -> type (Maven) -> java version(Any) 
            -> Next -> (SpringBoot 2.7) -> Spring Web(Select) -> Next -> Finish

            If JSP Render using add dependency in tomcat-jasper (Version based on your peroject tomcate server) to bom.xml


Spring Boot Web App Possibilities:
    1. Application properties:  
        spring.mvc.view.prefix = /Add Folder Name/
        spring.mvc.view.suffix = .jsp (or) .html
        server.port = <Customize Port Number>

Spring Initializr:
    1. Open Browser -> Type(Spring Initializr) -> Click On First Link  ->
        project - mavan
        language - java
        spring boot - Select lowest version
        group - default
        Artifact -<Customize name>
        .
        .
        .
        Packing = jasper
        java - select any version

        Right Site -> Add Dependancy
            1. Spring Configuration processor
            2. Spring web

        Click Generate.
    
    2. Cut the file and create new folder and paste zip file and extract the file inside the folder 
    -> Open Eclipse -> Right Import -> Import -> Existing Maven Project -> Next
    -> Route Dorectory - Open Extract Folder Select -> then Finish

    3. Create Controller Class And Create JSP file in (main/webapp) And Must add depentance for Rendering process in (tomcat-jasper-(Based on your project tomcate version)) And Run the application.

Spring Boot H2 Database:
    What is in-memory database?
        Inmemory database relies on system memory as oppose to disk spacr for storage of data.
        Because Acess is faster then disk accedd.
        *We use the in-memory database when we do not need to persist the data.
        in-memory database in an empaded database.
        The Widely used in-memory databases are H2, HSQLDB(HyperSQL Database) And Apache Derby.
        It Creates the Configurarion automatically.
    
    Prisistence VS In-Memory Database:
        The Prisistent database prsists the data in physical memory.
        The data will be able even if the database server is 'bounced'.
        Some popular persistence database are,
            Oracle
            MYSQL
            Postgres
            etc...
